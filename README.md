Technologies used:

- TailwindCSS

- Javascript

- HTML


Tools: 

- Visual Studio Code

Outcome:

Used tailwindCSS to design the page and make it look neat.
Used Javascript to work with the input text box and store input in a variable and use it
with the Forecast5 API. The Forecast5 API displayed the Temperature, Wind speed, and Humidity %
of the searched location.

Summary: 
Althought I couldnt't figure out how to implemet localstorage into my project, I pretty much learned how to work with an API on my own for the first time which was
a little confusing at first but then I understood it through trial and error.
The biggest thing I learned though was the tailwind framework. This was my first time
using something like this to build a webpage, and now I will most likely use it from now on in the future
and continue to get better with it.
